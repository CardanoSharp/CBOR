    <PackageReleaseNotes>
Version 4.0.0:

- Fix issues with CTAP2 Canonical CBOR form
- Support field serialization and deserialization in ToObject and FromObject

Version 4.0.0-beta2:

The features in this version include:

- The CBOR library no longer stores numbers in a special form beyond the CBOR data model, which represents all "65-bit" signed integers and all "double" values.  This means the CBOR library no longer stores certain numbers as EDecimal, EInteger, EFloat, etc., rather than as tagged CBOR objects.
- CBORObject.CompareTo now compares objects using the default deterministic encoding comparison in the draft revision of the CBOR specification, and no longer treats numbers (objects with the former type CBORType.Number) as a special class.
- CBORType.Number is deprecated; CBORObjects no longer have this type.  In its place, certain numbers now have new CBORTypes Integer or FloatingPoint.
- CBORObject now stores floating-point numbers internally as the bits that make them up, rather than as `double`s, to avoid data loss in conversions.
- Methods were added to CBORObject to read and write floating-point numbers in terms of their bit patterns rather than as `double`s or `float`s.
- Ctap2Canonical was made more strict and now works when decoding CBOR objects.
- Added ReadSequence and DecodeSequence to CBORObject for reading CBOR sequences.
- New CBORNumber class for storing numbers representable in CBOR.  The new CBORObject.IsNumber property checks whether a CBOR object represents a number.
- Bug fixes

Version 4.0.0-beta1:

- Support nullable types in CBORObject.ToObject.
- Update Numbers library to newer version
- JSONOptions.Base64Padding now has no effect.  The library will now write padding as necessary when
  writing traditional base64 to JSON and write no padding when writing base64url to JSON.
- JSONOptions.ReplaceSurrogates property added.
- Restrict valid shared reference indices to integers 0 or greater.
- Reject writing JSON where CBOR maps have two keys with the same string equivalent.
- Improve performance of CBOR object comparisons involving big floats.

Version 4.0.0-alpha2:

- Support CBOR tags for IRIs and IRI references.
- Add CBOREncodeOptions.DefaultCtap2Canonical field.

Version 4.0.0-alpha1:

- Remove all APIs obsoleted since version 3.4.  This
  includes the BigInteger, ExtendedDecimal, and ExtendedFloat APIs,
  which were renamed and moved to a different library, as well as the
  ICBORTag and CBORTypeFilter APIs.
- Changed implementation of FromObject, including imposing a nesting depth
  limit and supporting a CBORTypeMapper parameter.
- Property name conversion rules (in PODOptions) were changed
  in this version with respect to FromObject.  In this sense,
  PODOptions.RemoveIsPrefix was removed.
- Certain other changes in CBOR object reading and validation were
  made; they are largely compatible with previous versions but may be
  backwards-incompatible in certain rare cases
