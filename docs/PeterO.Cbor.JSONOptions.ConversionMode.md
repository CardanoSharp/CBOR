## PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode

    public sealed struct ConversionMode :
        System.Enum,

        System.IFormattable

Specifies how JSON numbers are converted to CBOR when decoding JSON.

### Member Summary
* <code>[public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Double = 1;](#Double)</code> - JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR as their closest-rounded approximation as 64-bit binary floating-point numbers.
* <code>[public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Full = 0;](#Full)</code> - JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR using the full precision given in the JSON text.
* <code>[public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode IntOrFloat = 2;](#IntOrFloat)</code> - A JSON number is decoded to CBOR either as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1) if the JSON number represents an integer at least -(2^53)+1 and less than 2^53, or as their closest-rounded approximation as 64-bit binary floating-point numbers otherwise.
* <code>[public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode IntOrFloatFromDouble = 3;](#IntOrFloatFromDouble)</code> - A JSON number is decoded to CBOR either as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1) if the number's closest-rounded approximation as a 64-bit binary floating-point number represents an integer at least -(2^53)+1 and less than 2^53, or as that approximation otherwise.

### Double

    public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Double = 1;

JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR as their closest-rounded approximation as 64-bit binary floating-point numbers. (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to positive or negative zero, and numbers of extremely large magnitude may overflow to infinity.).

<a id="Full"></a>
### Full

    public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Full = 0;

JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR using the full precision given in the JSON text. This may involve numbers being converted to arbitrary-precision integers or decimal numbers, where appropriate.

<a id="IntOrFloat"></a>
### IntOrFloat

    public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode IntOrFloat = 2;

A JSON number is decoded to CBOR either as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1) if the JSON number represents an integer at least -(2^53)+1 and less than 2^53, or as their closest-rounded approximation as 64-bit binary floating-point numbers otherwise. For example, the JSON number 0.99999999999999999999999999999999999 is not an integer, so it's converted to its closest floating-point approximation, namely 1.0. (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to positive or negative zero, and numbers of extremely large magnitude may overflow to infinity.).

<a id="IntOrFloatFromDouble"></a>
### IntOrFloatFromDouble

    public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode IntOrFloatFromDouble = 3;

A JSON number is decoded to CBOR either as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1) if the number's closest-rounded approximation as a 64-bit binary floating-point number represents an integer at least -(2^53)+1 and less than 2^53, or as that approximation otherwise. For example, the JSON number 0.99999999999999999999999999999999999 is the integer 1 when rounded to its closest floating-point approximation (1.0), so it's converted to the CBOR integer 1 (major type 0). (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to zero, and numbers of extremely large magnitude may overflow to infinity.).
