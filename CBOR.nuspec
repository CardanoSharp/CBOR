><metadata><version>4.0.0-beta1</version><id>PeterO.Cbor</id><requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance><releaseNotes>Version 4.0.0-beta1:

- Support nullable types in CBORObject.ToObject.
- Update Numbers library to newer version
- JSONOptions.Base64Padding now has no effect.  The library will now write padding as necessary when
  writing traditional base64 to JSON and write no padding when writing base64url to JSON.
- JSONOptions.ReplaceSurrogates property added.
- Restrict valid shared reference indices to integers 0 or greater.
- Reject writing JSON where CBOR maps have two keys with the same string equivalent.
- Improve performance of CBOR object comparisons involving big floats.

Version 4.0.0-alpha2:

- Support CBOR tags for IRIs and IRI references.
- Add CBOREncodeOptions.DefaultCtap2Canonical field.

Version 4.0.0-alpha1:

- Remove all APIs obsoleted since version 3.4.  This
  includes the BigInteger, ExtendedDecimal, and ExtendedFloat APIs,
  which were renamed and moved to a different library, as well as the
  ICBORTag and CBORTypeFilter APIs.
- Changed implementation of FromObject, including imposing a nesting depth
  limit and supporting a CBORTypeMapper parameter.
- Property name conversion rules (in PODOptions) were changed
  in this version with respect to FromObject.  In this sense,
  PODOptions.RemoveIsPrefix was removed.
- Certain other changes in CBOR object reading and validation were
  made; they are largely compatible with previous versions but may be
  backwards-incompatible in certain rare cases</releaseNotes><summary></summary><license type='expression'>CC0-1.0</license><projectUrl>https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR</projectUrl><authors>Peter Occil</authors><description>A C# implementation of Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), a general-purpose binary data format defined in RFC 7049.</description><owners>Peter Occil</owners><title>CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)</title><tags>cbor data serialization binary json</tags><dependencies><group><dependency id='PeterO.Numbers' version='1.4.3' /></group></dependencies></metadata><files><file src='CBOR/bin/Release/netstandard1.0/CBOR.dll' target='/lib/netstandard1.0' /><file src='CBOR/bin/Release/netstandard1.0/CBOR.xml' target='/lib/netstandard1.0' /><file src='CBOR20/bin/Release/CBOR.dll' target='/lib/net20' /><file src='CBOR20/bin/Release/CBOR.xml' target='/lib/net20' /><file src='CBOR40/bin/Release/CBOR.dll' target='/lib/net40' /><file src='CBOR40/bin/Release/CBOR.xml' target='/lib/net40' /></files></package
