The features in this version include:

- The CBOR library no longer stores numbers in a special form beyond the CBOR data model, which represents all &quot;65-bit&quot; signed integers and all &quot;double&quot; values.  This means the CBOR library no longer stores certain numbers as EDecimal, EInteger, EFloat, etc., rather than as tagged CBOR objects.
- CBORObject.CompareTo now compares objects using the default deterministic encoding comparison in the draft revision of the CBOR specification, and no longer treats numbers (objects with the former type CBORType.Number) as a special class.
- CBORType.Number is deprecated; CBORObjects no longer have this type.  In its place, certain numbers now have new CBORTypes Integer or FloatingPoint.
- CBORObject now stores floating-point numbers internally as the bits that make them up, rather than as `double`s, to avoid data loss in conversions.
- Methods were added to CBORObject to read and write floating-point numbers in terms of their bit patterns rather than as `double`s or `float`s.
- Ctap2Canonical was made more strict and now works when decoding CBOR objects.
- Added ReadSequence and DecodeSequence to CBORObject for reading CBOR sequences.
- New CBORNumber class for storing numbers representable in CBOR.  The new CBORObject.IsNumber property checks whether a CBOR object represents a number.
